Here are some examples of the use of [HersheyPy](https://github.com/ldo/hersheypy),
for accessing the Hershey fonts from Python 3 via Cairo.

Each example script generates its output to a PNG file with the same
basename as the script. Thus, to run a script *script* and see its
output, you could do something like

> ./*script* && display *script*.png
