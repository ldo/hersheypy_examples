Here are some examples of the use of HersheyPy
([GitLab](https://gitlab.com/ldo/hersheypy),
[BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/ldo17/hersheypy)), for accessing the Hershey
fonts from Python 3 via Cairo.

Each example script generates its output to a PNG file with the same
basename as the script. Thus, to run a script *script* and see its
output, you could do something like

> ./*script* && display *script*.png

Alternatively, you can see the generated output on my [DeviantArt
account](https://default-cube.deviantart.com/gallery/54390594/HersheyPy-Examples).
